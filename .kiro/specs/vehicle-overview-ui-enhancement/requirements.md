# Requirements Document

## Introduction

The vehicle overview page currently displays comprehensive vehicle information, statistics, and expense data. However, the UI uses a mix of custom CSS classes (`.card`, `.card-compact`) and shadcn/ui components, creating visual inconsistency with other sections of the application. This feature will standardize the vehicle overview page to exclusively use shadcn/ui components, improving visual consistency, maintainability, and user experience while enhancing the information architecture.
