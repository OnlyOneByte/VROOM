# Import from Other Trackers — Tasks

> **UNBLOCKED: Angelo signed off D1–D5 (all ✅ recommended) cycle 12 — build is GO.** Backend-first
> per CLAUDE.md. Each task is one loop increment; verify before ticking. The whole feature is additive
> — the native CSV-import path stays the default when no `mapping` is sent, so nothing here risks it.

## Phase 0 — sign-off (gates everything)
- [x] **T0** Angelo ratified D1–D5 at the ✅ recommended option for each (cycle 12). Design
      `[depends on Dx]` sections already assume those options; build T1+.

## Phase 1 — backend mapping core (pure, no I/O)
- [x] **T1 (cycle 58)** `import-mapping.ts`: `ColumnMapping` type + `applyMapping(foreignCsv, mapping, target)`
      → native-shape CSV. Unit conversion INTO the target vehicle's units (reuses `unit-conversions.ts`),
      decimal-comma, category map (+ `unmappedCategories` visible flag), **local-time** date normalization
      across iso/mdy/dmy/epoch (cycle-6/11 discipline). Pure (no DB/Hono); fully additive — the native import
      path is unchanged and stays default when no mapping is sent. 14 unit tests incl. the timezone-independent
      local-day invariant AND a load-bearing `applyMapping`→`buildImportPlan` round-trip proving the emitted
      native CSV is consumable end-to-end. backend validate:local EXIT 0 (987 pass, +14).
- [x] **T2 (cycle 64)** `import-mapping-presets.ts`: static `MappingPreset` table for Fuelly/Fuelio/Drivvo
      [D5] + `detectSource(headers)` + `presetToMapping(preset, targetVehicle)`. Detection is normalized
      (lower-case + strip non-alphanumerics) + SUBSTRING-based on a DISTINCTIVE signature subset (Fuelly
      `odometer`+`fillamount`, Fuelio `odo`+`litres`, Drivvo `totalprice`+`typeoffuel`) so real-world header
      decoration doesn't defeat it and the presets don't cross-detect; unknown files → null (safe → manual
      mapping). Pure; 10 unit tests (each signature, unknown/empty, drift tolerance, no-cross-detect,
      every-preset-detects-its-own-columns self-consistency, presetToMapping→applyMapping round-trip).
      backend validate:local EXIT 0 (1006 pass, +10). NOTE: column strings are best-effort from documented
      exports — validating against a REAL Fuelly/Fuelio/Drivvo file is deferred to T6 (a mis-detect is the
      safe failure: null → manual mapping, never a wrong auto-map).

## Phase 2 — route (backward-compatible)
- [x] **T3 (cycle 70)** Extended `POST /import` with an optional `mapping` (Zod `columnMappingSchema`):
      when present, resolve the target vehicle's units → `applyMapping` → the EXISTING
      `buildImportPlan`/dryRun/`importExpenses` flow (no new write path). `unmappedCategories` added to the
      response. Added `POST /import/detect` (header names → preset or null) for the client. BACKWARD-COMPAT:
      no `mapping` → the native path runs unchanged. C60 wiring risk handled: units convert toward the
      resolved targetVehicle's unitPreferences (skipped when no match, never a guess). 9 HTTP tests
      (Fuelio preview/commit, metric→imperial conversion, idempotent re-import, unmapped-category surface,
      malformed-row per-row, unparseable→400, detect preset/null, native backward-compat). CAUGHT a real
      schema bug pre-merge: `z.record(z.enum(NativeField))` is EXHAUSTIVE in Zod v4 (rejected a partial
      `columns`) → rewrote as explicit per-field optionals. backend validate:local EXIT 0 (1038 pass, +9).

## Phase 3 — frontend
- [~] **T4** Import-dialog mapping step: detected-source banner, per-field column dropdowns from the
      file headers, unit/date-format/target-vehicle pickers, category-remap table. Reuse the existing
      preview/commit step. Types + service wiring.
      - [x] **Types + service wiring DONE (C140, non-eyes-on):** `src/lib/types/import-mapping.ts`
            (ImportColumnMapping/ImportMappingPreset/NativeImportField mirroring the backend) +
            `expenseApi.importExpensesCsv(csv, dryRun, mapping?)` (backward-compat) +
            `detectImportSource(headers)`; +5 tests.
      - [x] **AUTO-DETECT + target-vehicle slice DONE (C31, eyes-on CONFIRMED):** ImportExpensesDialog
            now (1) auto-detects a Fuelly/Fuelio/Drivvo fuel log from its headers (`detectImportSource`),
            (2) shows a "Detected a <Tracker> fuel log" banner + a target-vehicle picker (these presets
            carry no `vehicle` column → D4 requires picking one; auto-selects the only vehicle), (3) builds
            the `ImportColumnMapping` from the preset + chosen vehicle and reuses the existing preview/commit
            step verbatim. A native VROOM export (has its own vehicle column) detects null → unchanged path.
            Eyes-on via `import-mapping-detect.meshclaw.e2e.ts` + shot (`/tmp/c31-import-mapped-preview.png`):
            banner + picker render, "Daily Driver" auto-selected. FE validate:local GREEN (726).
      - [x] **MANUAL column-mapping path DONE (C37, eyes-on CONFIRMED):** for an UNRECOGNIZED foreign CSV
            (no preset match, not a native VROOM export), the dialog now renders a "Map your columns" editor
            — a per-field dropdown for each VROOM field (date*/amount*/category/vehicle/mileage/volume/
            fuelType/description/tags) populated from the file's own headers + a date-format picker + the
            target-vehicle picker (shown only when no vehicle column is mapped, D4). Initial guesses
            auto-map by header-name substring (date/amount[+spent/paid/total]/category[+kind]/…); the user
            adjusts. buildMapping emits the ImportColumnMapping (drops unmapped fields) → the existing
            preview/commit runs verbatim. Eyes-on via `import-manual-mapping.meshclaw.e2e.ts` + 2 shots
            (Read): a bespoke CSV (Transaction Date/Spent/Kind/Notes) → editor with guessed mappings →
            "1 ready · 1 row needs attention" after picking the vehicle (the maintenance row imports; the
            fuel row correctly errors "fuel rows require fuel amount and mileage"). FE validate:local GREEN.
      - [x] **MANUAL UNIT pickers DONE (C41, eyes-on CONFIRMED):** the manual path now exposes Odometer-unit
            + Volume-unit pickers (shown only when those columns are mapped), defaulting to the target
            vehicle's units (= no conversion baseline). `buildMapping` sends the file's distanceUnit/volumeUnit
            only when the matching column is mapped, so applyMapping converts INTO the vehicle's units —
            closing the C37 gap where a metric log imported raw (NORTH_STAR #2). Eyes-on via
            `import-manual-units.meshclaw.e2e.ts` + shot: a km/litres log mapped + units set to Kilometers/
            Liters → committed row converted 160.9344 km→100 mi, 37.854 L→~10 US gal (verified via API).
            Field/unit Select triggers got `data-testid`s for deterministic e2e targeting.
      - [x] **CATEGORY-REMAP table DONE (C47, eyes-on CONFIRMED):** when a preview surfaces
            `unmappedCategories` (a foreign category WORD the importer didn't recognize → falls back to misc,
            D2 "never invent"), the dialog renders an "Unrecognized categories" panel — one row per word + a
            VROOM-category `Select` (reusing the canonical `categoryLabels`). Assigning a word folds it into
            the mapping's `categoryMap` (merged over any preset map; user choices win) and re-previews, so
            the word resolves + drops out of the list and its rows re-categorize. Eyes-on via
            `import-category-remap.meshclaw.e2e.ts` + 2 shots (Read): a bespoke CSV with `Type=servicing` →
            "Unrecognized categories" panel renders → map servicing→Maintenance → panel disappears, "1 ready"
            → committed row imported as `maintenance` (NOT the misc fallback, verified via API). Remap trigger
            got `data-testid="remap-category-{word}"`. FE validate:local GREEN (735).
      - [ ] **REMAINING (T4 follow-ups):** the Angelo-gated preset `defaultCategory`. **BLOCKER surfaced +
            flagged to Angelo C31:** the fuel presets map no category column and `mapCategory` leaves a blank
            category blank (D2 "never invent"), so a DETECTED fuel log previews 0-ready ("Unknown category").
            Recommended fix (a): give each fuel preset a `defaultCategory:'fuel'` (backend-preset change,
            awaiting the steer) — until then the auto-detect path detects+maps but commits nothing. (NOTE: the
            C47 remap table does NOT solve this — a detected preset maps no category COLUMN at all, so there's
            no word to remap; the gap is the missing column, which is the parked `defaultCategory` decision.)
- [ ] **T5** Four-states + a11y + mobile; compose from the kit.

## Phase 4 — verify
- [~] **T6** E2E (auto-detected preset path + manual-mapping path, mi + km vehicle) + eyes-on
      screenshots of all four states. regress.sh green. Consider extending the `no-utc-month-parse`
      guard to cover `import-mapping.ts`.
      - [x] **DATE-GUARD slice DONE (C54):** the merge-surviving no-utc guard for the import date paths is
            committed — `no-utc-import-date.test.ts` (+3) scans import-mapping.ts / local-date.ts /
            import-csv.ts for a Date built from a date-only string OR `${y}-${m}-${d}` template (the
            midnight-UTC rollback, #23/#59/#87), and pins that import-mapping still routes through
            buildLocalDate. Non-vacuous BOTH ways (both antipattern forms → RED; the 2 legit new Date(ms)/
            new Date(s) sites don't false-flag). The behavioral net (import-mapping.test.ts local-time
            discipline across iso/mdy/dmy/epoch) already existed; this is the structural tree-wide net.
      - [x] **MANUAL FUEL round-trip (same-unit, mi/gallons) DONE (C61, eyes-on CONFIRMED):** the common
            real case the per-slice specs hadn't committed — a complete manual fuel log (date/amount/
            category/odometer/volume/fuelType/description all mapped) on a MILES vehicle with units left at
            the vehicle's defaults (no conversion) → commits a real `fuel` expense with EXACT mileage 42000
            + volume 11.5 (verified via API, no conversion drift). `import-t6-manual-fuel-roundtrip
            .meshclaw.e2e.ts` + shot (Read): the "Map your columns" editor with all fields mapped, units
            Miles/Gallons (US), "1 ready" → "Import 1 row". Complements C41 (km→mi conversion) + C37 (the
            maintenance row / the fuel row's missing-field error). FE validate:local GREEN (735).
      - [ ] **REMAINING (T6, BLOCKED):** the AUTO-DETECT PRESET round-trip THROUGH COMMIT. A detected
            Fuelly/Fuelio/Drivvo log maps NO category column, so `mapCategory` leaves it blank (D2 "never
            invent") → the preview is 0-ready ("Unknown category") and there's nothing to commit. The C47
            remap table does NOT help (a preset maps no category COLUMN, so there's no word to remap). This
            is the parked `defaultCategory:'fuel'`-per-preset decision (send_message'd Angelo C31) — the
            detect-path commit can't be exercised until he rules. The manual path (the committable half) is
            now fully eyes-on (C37/C41/C47/C61). Four-state screenshots are likewise gated on the detect
            commit for the populated-detect state.
