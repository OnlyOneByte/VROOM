# Requirements Document

## Introduction

VROOM is a web-based car cost tracking and visualization system designed to help users monitor, analyze, and share vehicle expenses across multiple cars. The system prioritizes cost-effective hosting solutions, mobile-friendly interfaces, and comprehensive data visualization capabilities while maintaining the flexibility for self-hosting via Docker containers.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a car owner, I want to enter costs and expenses through a responsive web interface, so that I can track my vehicle expenses from any device.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user accesses the website on desktop THEN the system SHALL display a responsive interface optimized for desktop screens
2. WHEN a user accesses the website on mobile THEN the system SHALL display a mobile-optimized interface with touch-friendly controls
3. WHEN a user enters cost data THEN the system SHALL validate and store the information with appropriate categories
4. WHEN a user submits an expense entry THEN the system SHALL provide immediate confirmation of successful data storage

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a multi-car owner, I want to manage multiple vehicles in one account, so that I can track expenses for all my cars in a centralized location.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user creates an account THEN the system SHALL allow adding multiple vehicle profiles
2. WHEN a user adds a new car THEN the system SHALL require basic vehicle information (make, model, year, license plate)
3. WHEN a user views their dashboard THEN the system SHALL display all registered vehicles with summary statistics
4. WHEN a user selects a specific vehicle THEN the system SHALL filter all data views to that vehicle's records

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a user, I want to securely authenticate using existing accounts, so that I can access the system without creating additional passwords or sharing personal data.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user accesses the login page THEN the system SHALL provide OAuth authentication options (Google, GitHub, etc.)
2. WHEN a user authenticates via OAuth THEN the system SHALL store only the minimum required identifier and display name
3. WHEN a user logs in successfully THEN the system SHALL create a secure session without storing sensitive personal data
4. WHEN a user logs out THEN the system SHALL invalidate the session and clear authentication tokens
5. WHEN the system handles user data THEN it SHALL comply with privacy best practices and avoid storing unnecessary personal information

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a car owner, I want to share vehicle data with other users, so that family members or co-owners can contribute to expense tracking.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user owns a vehicle record THEN the system SHALL provide options to share access with other users by their authenticated identity
2. WHEN a user receives a sharing invitation THEN the system SHALL allow them to accept or decline access
3. WHEN a shared user accesses a vehicle THEN the system SHALL enforce appropriate permission levels (view-only or edit)
4. IF a user has edit permissions THEN the system SHALL allow them to add expenses and modify vehicle data

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a cost-conscious user, I want an abstracted storage backend with robust data portability, so that I can easily switch between storage solutions and maintain control over my data.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the system is designed THEN it SHALL implement an abstracted storage interface that supports multiple backend types
2. WHEN Google Sheets is used as a backend THEN the system SHALL store different cost categories in separate sheets
3. WHEN alternative storage is needed THEN the system SHALL support lightweight database solutions with detailed cost analysis
4. WHEN data portability is required THEN the system SHALL provide comprehensive export functionality in multiple formats (JSON, CSV, Excel)
5. WHEN importing data THEN the system SHALL support importing from exported formats to enable backend migration
6. WHEN hosting costs are analyzed THEN the system SHALL document monthly expenses and provide cost-optimization recommendations

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a data-driven car owner, I want comprehensive visualizations of my vehicle expenses, so that I can understand spending patterns and make informed decisions.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user views analytics THEN the system SHALL display cost per month trends over time
2. WHEN a user views analytics THEN the system SHALL calculate and display miles per month statistics
3. WHEN a user views analytics THEN the system SHALL compute cost per mile metrics
4. WHEN a user views analytics THEN the system SHALL track total gallons of fuel consumed
5. WHEN a user views analytics THEN the system SHALL provide interactive charts and graphs for all metrics
6. WHEN a user selects a time range THEN the system SHALL filter all visualizations to the specified period

### Requirement 7

**User Story:** As a fuel-conscious driver, I want to track fuel efficiency over time, so that I can monitor my vehicle's performance and identify potential maintenance needs.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user enters fuel purchase data THEN the system SHALL calculate miles per gallon (MPG) for each fill-up
2. WHEN a user views fuel efficiency THEN the system SHALL display MPG trends over time with visual indicators
3. WHEN MPG drops significantly THEN the system SHALL highlight potential efficiency concerns
4. WHEN comparing time periods THEN the system SHALL show fuel efficiency improvements or degradation
5. WHEN viewing vehicle summaries THEN the system SHALL display average MPG for each vehicle

### Requirement 8

**User Story:** As a self-hosting enthusiast, I want to deploy VROOM on my own infrastructure, so that I can maintain control over my data and integrate with my existing home lab setup.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the application is packaged THEN the system SHALL provide a Docker container with all dependencies
2. WHEN deploying via Docker THEN the system SHALL be compatible with Portainer management interfaces
3. WHEN building the application THEN the system SHALL include comprehensive documentation for self-hosting setup
4. WHEN deployed locally THEN the system SHALL maintain full functionality without external dependencies (except chosen backend storage)
5. IF using external storage THEN the system SHALL clearly document required API keys and configuration steps

## Future Considerations (P2/Stretch Goals)

### Maintenance Reminders (Stretch)
- Track maintenance schedules and send reminders for oil changes, inspections, etc.

### Photo Attachments (P1 Stretch)  
- Store receipt photos and maintenance records (pending storage cost analysis)

### Trip Categorization (P2)
- Separate business vs personal miles for tax purposes

### Advanced Analytics (Future)
- Vehicle comparison tools, budget alerts, and mileage predictions
