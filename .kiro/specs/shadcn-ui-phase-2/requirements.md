# Requirements Document - Phase 2: Advanced shadcn/ui Integration

## Introduction

This document extends the initial shadcn/ui standardization effort to include advanced components and patterns identified in the SHADCN_OPPORTUNITIES.md analysis. Phase 1 successfully migrated basic components (Badge, Alert, Avatar, Dropdown Menu, Select, Textarea, Switch, Sheet, Popover). Phase 2 focuses on enhancing user experience with advanced components like Dialog/AlertDialog, Table, Tabs, Accordion, Progress, Radio Group, Command Palette, Scroll Area, and improved form patterns.

The goal is to leverage shadcn/ui's full component library to improve accessibility, consistency, and user experience while following frontend best practices for component usage.
