# LEDGER — VROOM autonomous loop

> Append-only cycle log + the balance table. Update BOTH every cycle:
> bump the touched category's "last-touched cycle", then add a one-line log entry.
>
> **Fresh start 2026-06-16.** The C1–C467 history was archived to
> `loop/archive/LEDGER-C1-C467.md` (+ `BACKLOG-C1-C467.md`) to keep the loop's read-path lean.
> Everything still-open carried into the fresh `BACKLOG.md`; everything done lives in the archive
> (and in git). Read `GUIDE.md` first, then NORTH_STAR, then BACKLOG. Skim THIS file's balance
> table + the last ~3 entries only — never the whole log.
>
> **COVERAGE TREND (loop-improvement #4): end every cycle-log entry with a `cov:` tag** —
> `cov: be <pct>% / fe <pct>%`. Carry the prior numbers forward + mark `~` if you didn't
> re-measure this cycle; re-measure (`bun test --coverage` / vitest `--coverage`) on guard/arch/bug
> cycles that touch a module. Goal 90% both (structural ceiling ~86% BE / ~84% FE per the archive —
> the remaining gap is eyes-on FE components, now shootable via shot.sh). Last measured before reset
> (archive C323): **BE 86.5% line / FE 84.4% line** — treat as the floor, re-measure to confirm.

## Balance table
`starved-for = current cycle − last-touched`. If `starved-for > budget` for any category,
the next increment MUST come from the most-starved over-budget category. Recompute ALL 6 every
cycle (slow-budget categories mis-forecast otherwise).

| Category | Budget | Last touched (cycle) |
|---|---:|---|
| feature | 4 | 0 |
| deep-review | 5 | 0 |
| guard | 6 | 0 |
| bug | 3 | 0 |
| arch | 5 | 0 |
| infra | 6 | 0 |

Current cycle: **0**

> Reset to 0 (true fresh start, 2026-06-16). Nothing is over budget yet at C1, so the first few
> cycles take the highest-leverage open item; prefer spreading across categories. The branch is
> already ~150 commits deep and PR-ready — this reset is documentation hygiene, not a code reset.
