# LEDGER — VROOM autonomous loop

> Append-only cycle log + the balance table. Update BOTH every cycle:
> bump the touched category's "last-touched cycle", then add a one-line log entry.

## Balance table
`starved-for = current cycle − last-touched`. If `starved-for > budget` for any category,
the next increment MUST come from the most-starved over-budget category.

| Category | Budget | Last touched (cycle) |
|---|---:|---|
| feature | 4 | 4 |
| deep-review | 5 | 7 |
| guard | 6 | 6 |
| bug | 3 | 7 |
| infra | 6 | 5 |

Current cycle: **7**

## Cycle log
- **C1 (infra)** — Bootstrapped the `loop/` scaffold the loop format depends on:
  NORTH_STAR.md (vision + quality bar + guardrails), BACKLOG.md (5 categories with
  starvation budgets + seeded ranked queue), this LEDGER, and push.sh. No product code
  touched; verified the scaffold is self-consistent (categories in BACKLOG == LEDGER table).
  Next cycle: nothing is over budget yet, so take highest-leverage — the `infra` item
  "CLAUDE.md stale refs" (cheap, unblocks fresh-clone orientation) or the top `guard`
  (EUR visual guard). Prefer spreading: pick a non-infra category next.
- **C2 (guard)** — Pinned the cycle-201 mobile-wrap fix. Found the top `guard` item
  ("EUR/unit visual guard") was ALREADY built (insurance-currency-label +
  vehicle-form-unit-defaults e2e), so took guard #2 (category-grid no-wrap, c201). Key
  insight: an e2e spec is untracked-by-design (`*.meshclaw.e2e.ts`) so it doesn't survive
  a merge — quality-bar #5 needs a MERGE-SURVIVING guard. Followed the cycle-205/206
  source-scan pattern: committed `category-selector-labels.test.ts` (fast unit suite) that
  asserts all six CategorySelector labels are single-word (a multi-word label wraps in the
  2-col mobile grid). Also dropped a runtime e2e (untracked) that measures actual wrap.
  Verified: guard unit test green (2/2), frontend type-check 0 errors, build done, e2e
  passes against the real component. No product code touched.
  Next cycle: still nothing over budget. Spread again — candidates: `deep-review` (vehicle
  Overview/ExpensesTable eyes-on, or Sheets restore path) or `infra` (CLAUDE.md stale
  refs). Prefer a deep-review to exercise that starved category before its budget bites.
- **C3 (deep-review → bug)** — Fanned out 2 parallel Explore agents (Sheets restore path +
  vehicle Overview/ExpensesTable). The Sheets agent surfaced a REAL data-safety bug
  (quality-bar #1): the Sheets backup writes each table through a HAND-MAINTAINED column
  list (`getXHeaders()`), and `expenses.clientId` (the offline-sync idempotency key) was
  missing — so it was silently dropped on every Google Sheets backup→restore round-trip
  and restored as null, while the schema-derived CSV path preserved it. Verified firsthand
  + computed the full drift across all 15 tables (clientId was the ONLY one). Bugs jump the
  queue → fixed this cycle: (1) centralized the 15 header arrays into one exported
  `SHEET_HEADERS` map (single source of truth; deleted the 15 dead getters), added
  `clientId`; (2) committed `sheets-header-coverage.test.ts` — a schema-vs-headers superset
  guard (cycle-208/209 pattern) that bites today and pins the whole drift class. Verified:
  tsc 0 errors · Biome (musl) clean · 846 pass/0 fail (incl. the real Sheets round-trip
  test, now carrying clientId) · build bundled. The UI agent's findings are filed as
  backlog items (none data-safety; logged below). marks this cycle infra-light, product-real.
  Next cycle: `feature` (budget 4) and `infra` (CLAUDE.md stale refs) are the most starved.
  Prefer the cheap `infra` (CLAUDE.md still says "Biome can't run" + points at gitignored
  STATUS.md/LOOP.md — wrong for a fresh clone), or pick up a UI deep-review finding as a `bug`.
- **C4 (feature → spec)** — `feature` was over budget (never touched, budget 4), so the rule
  forced a feature pick. Its first loop phase is SPEC (build gated on Angelo sign-off), so the
  increment is the spec, not code. Fanned out 2 Explore agents to scope the reuse surface:
  (1) reminders engine is 100% time-based; mileage was never scoped/deferred; `reminder_vehicles`
  junction + notification feed + ReminderForm/DueRemindersCard are reusable. (2) odometer is a
  bare integer in the vehicle's distance unit (convert-on-read, no canonical unit); NO
  "current odometer" helper exists (two competing notions: fuel-only `vehicle-stats.currentMileage`
  vs the date-ordered `getHistory` UNION). Drafted `.kiro/specs/maintenance-schedule/`
  {requirements,design,tasks}.md: extend reminders with a `triggerMode` + nullable mileage columns
  (additive), a new max-by-value `getCurrentOdometer` helper, whichever-comes-first OR-logic,
  mark-serviced re-arm, mileage-recheck-on-write, and R9 backup/Sheets-header coverage. Six open
  product decisions (D1–D6) flagged for sign-off; recommended option given for each; tasks.md is
  BLOCKED on T0. Flagged Angelo via send_message; did NOT block — moved on.
  Verify (spec-only): cross-checked D1–D6 referenced consistently across all three files +
  file:line groundings from the scoping pass. No build (no code).
  Next cycle: with feature freshly touched, `infra` (cyc 1, budget 6) and `guard` (cyc 2) are
  the next most-starved; or pick up a UI-review `bug` (the month-trend midnight-UTC date is a
  cheap one-liner). The maintenance build itself stays blocked until D1–D6 sign-off.
- **C5 (infra)** — Reconciled CLAUDE.md stale refs that actively mislead a fresh agent
  (most-starved category). Four fixes, each verified against reality: (1) the "Biome CLI can't
  run, fix by hand" claim → corrected to "use the musl binary" (`cli-linux-arm64-musl/biome`,
  confirmed v2.4.16 runs; the glibc one `bun run check` calls is dead) + a VERIFY note that
  `validate` fails only at `check`. (2) Branch convention `autopilot/<task>` → the long-lived
  `claude-loop-dev` branch; dropped the "inherited from .meshclaw-autopilot/LOOP.md" header
  (that file is gitignored now). (3) "read STATUS.md, kept current each cycle" → read the tracked
  `loop/{NORTH_STAR,BACKLOG,LEDGER}.md`; noted STATUS.md/BRANCH_REVIEW.md/.meshclaw-autopilot are
  gitignored and absent from a fresh clone. (4) Refreshed the highlights/gaps (insurance, CSV,
  Sheets-header guard, maintenance spec awaiting sign-off). Verified: musl biome runs; loop/ +
  the sheets guard are tracked; STATUS.md/BRANCH_REVIEW.md are NOT tracked. Docs-only, no build.
  Next cycle: `guard` (cyc 2, budget 6) is now most-starved, then `deep-review` (cyc 3). A
  cheap, high-value option is the month-trend midnight-UTC `bug` (one-line parseMonthToDate fix
  + a guard) — pairs a starved `bug`/`deep-review` finding with a regression guard.
- **C6 (bug + guard)** — Fixed the month-trend midnight-UTC date bug (C3 UI-review finding #2;
  `bug` was at-budget, `guard` most-starved — one increment advances both). `new Date(period +
  '-01')` parses as midnight UTC → x-axis month label shifts back one for negative-offset users.
  Routed through the sanctioned local-time `parseMonthToDate` on the vehicle-detail page.
  Added TWO committed (merge-surviving) guards: (1) a `parseMonthToDate` unit test in
  chart-formatters.test.ts (the helper had ZERO coverage despite every chart relying on it),
  pinning local-midnight + correct rendered month; (2) a source-scan guard `no-utc-month-parse`
  (cycle-205/206 pattern) that fails if any source reintroduces `new Date(<expr> + '-01')`.
  The guard immediately EARNED ITS KEEP: it caught a SECOND live instance I'd missed —
  dashboard/+page.svelte:87 `new Date(\`${t.period}-01\`)` — same bug, now fixed too. Tightened
  the regex to exclude full literal dates (`'2024-01-01'`) so it flags only the concat/interp
  antipattern. Verified: 6/6 new tests green, tsc 0 errors, build done, no remaining offenders.
  Next cycle: `deep-review` (cyc 3, budget 5) is now most-starved → take an eyes-on UI sweep
  (vehicle Overview/ExpensesTable, or analytics route) or a backend correctness audit. The
  remaining UI-review bugs (load-masquerade error state, page-local vehicle-detail filter,
  interpolated h-[…]) are still queued.
- **C7 (deep-review → bug + guard)** — Fanned out 2 Explore agents (CSV-import correctness +
  analytics aggregation math). Both surfaced real bugs. Fixed the HIGHEST-severity one:
  `buildFuelStatsFromData` (analytics/repository.ts) pooled odometer readings across ALL
  vehicles into one max-min, so a multi-vehicle user saw a garbage `totalDistance` on the
  dashboard summary (e.g. cars at 12k + 95k mi → ~83k "driven"). Wrong-but-plausible, on the
  most-viewed surface. Fixed by grouping per vehicle and summing per-car ranges (mirrors the
  existing computeConvertedTotalDistance). Pinned with a deterministic two-vehicle regression
  test in fuel-stats.property.test.ts (1000+500 → 1500, not pooled 80500). Single-vehicle path
  unchanged. Verified: 847 pass/0 fail (+1), tsc 0, Biome musl clean, build bundled.
  The reviews surfaced more REAL bugs now queued (see BACKLOG bug list): CSV-import has no
  idempotency (re-import duplicates rows), non-atomic partial commit, no BOM strip (Excel-edited
  files fail wholesale), date-only midnight-UTC, currency column ignored; analytics has
  missed-fillup MPG/cost-chart corruption, buildMonthlyConsumption slice(0,12) showing OLDEST
  months, and local-tz month bucketing. Several are data-safety — strong candidates next cycles.
  Next cycle (8): nothing over budget (deep-review & bug both fresh at 7, guard 6, infra 5,
  feature 4 → feature starved-for 4 = AT budget, breaches at cycle 9). Prefer the highest-value
  queued `bug` (CSV-import BOM strip is a clean low-risk one-liner; idempotency / missed-fillup
  MPG are higher-severity data-safety) — or take `feature` before it breaches if maintenance
  sign-off has landed.
